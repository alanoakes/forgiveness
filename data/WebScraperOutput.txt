H5375 - Rth 1:14 - And they lifted up ^H5375 their voice, ^H6963 and wept again: ^H1058 and Orpah ^H6204 kissed ^H5401 her mother in law; ^H2545 but Ruth ^H7327 clave ^H1692 unto her.
H5375 - Rth 2:18 - And she took it up, ^H5375 and went ^H935 into the city: ^H5892 and her mother in law ^H2545 saw ^H7200 what she had gleaned: ^H3950 and she brought forth, ^H3318 and gave ^H5414 to her that she had reserved ^H3498 after she was sufficed. ^H7648

H5375 - 1Sa 4:4 - So the people ^H5971 sent ^H7971 to Shiloh, ^H7887 that they might bring ^H5375 from thence the ark ^H727 of the covenant ^H1285 of the LORD ^H3068 of hosts, ^H6635 which dwelleth ^H3427 between the cherubims: ^H3742 and the two ^H8147 sons ^H1121 of Eli, ^H5941 Hophni ^H2652 and Phinehas, ^H6372 were there with the ark ^H727 of the covenant ^H1285 of God. ^H430
H5375 - 1Sa 6:13 - And they of Bethshemesh ^H1053 were reaping ^H7114 their wheat ^H2406 harvest ^H7105 in the valley: ^H6010 and they lifted up ^H5375 their eyes, ^H5869 and saw ^H7200 the ark, ^H727 and rejoiced ^H8055 to see ^H7200 it.
H5375 - 1Sa 10:3 - Then shalt thou go on ^H2498 forward ^H1973 from thence, and thou shalt come ^H935 to the plain ^H436 of Tabor, ^H8396 and there shall meet ^H4672 thee three ^H7969 men ^H582 going up ^H5927 to God ^H430 to Bethel, ^H1008 one ^H259 carrying ^H5375 three ^H7969 kids, ^H1423 and another ^H259 carrying ^H5375 three ^H7969 loaves ^H3603 of bread, ^H3899 and another ^H259 carrying ^H5375 a bottle ^H5035 of wine: ^H3196

H5375 - 1Sa 14:1 - Now it came to pass upon a day, ^H3117 that Jonathan ^H3129 the son ^H1121 of Saul ^H7586 said ^H559 unto the young man ^H5288 that bare ^H5375 his armour, ^H3627 Come, ^H3212 and let us go over ^H5674 to the Philistines' ^H6430 garrison, ^H4673 that is on the other side. ^H5676 ^H1975 But he told ^H5046 not his father. ^H1
H5375 - 1Sa 14:3 - And Ahiah, ^H281 the son ^H1121 of Ahitub, ^H285 Ichabod's ^H350 brother, ^H251 the son ^H1121 of Phinehas, ^H6372 the son ^H1121 of Eli, ^H5941 the LORD'S ^H3068 priest ^H3548 in Shiloh, ^H7887 wearing ^H5375 an ephod. ^H646 And the people ^H5971 knew ^H3045 not that Jonathan ^H3129 was gone. ^H1980
H5375 - 1Sa 14:6 - And Jonathan ^H3083 said ^H559 to the young man ^H5288 that bare ^H5375 his armour, ^H3627 Come, ^H3212 and let us go over ^H5674 unto the garrison ^H4673 of these uncircumcised: ^H6189 it may be that the LORD ^H3068 will work ^H6213 for us: for there is no restraint ^H4622 to the LORD ^H3068 to save ^H3467 by many ^H7227 or by few. ^H4592
H5375 - 1Sa 14:7 - And his armourbearer ^H5375 ^H3627 said ^H559 unto him, Do ^H6213 all that is in thine heart: ^H3824 turn ^H5186 thee; behold, I am with thee according to thy heart. ^H3824
H5375 - 1Sa 14:12 - And the men ^H582 of the garrison ^H4675 answered ^H6030 Jonathan ^H3129 and his armourbearer, ^H5375 ^H3627 and said, ^H559 Come up ^H5927 to us, and we will shew ^H3045 you a thing. ^H1697 And Jonathan ^H3129 said ^H559 unto his armourbearer, ^H5375 ^H3627 Come up ^H5927 after ^H310 me: for the LORD ^H3068 hath delivered ^H5414 them into the hand ^H3027 of Israel. ^H3478
H5375 - 1Sa 14:13 - And Jonathan ^H3129 climbed up ^H5927 upon his hands ^H3027 and upon his feet, ^H7272 and his armourbearer ^H5375 ^H3627 after ^H310 him: and they fell ^H5307 before ^H6440 Jonathan; ^H3129 and his armourbearer ^H5375 ^H3627 slew ^H4191 after ^H310 him.
H5375 - 1Sa 14:14 - And that first ^H7223 slaughter, ^H4347 which Jonathan ^H3129 and his armourbearer ^H5375 ^H3627 made, ^H5221 was about twenty ^H6242 men, ^H376 within as it were an half ^H2677 acre ^H4618 of land, ^H7704 which a yoke ^H6776 of oxen might plow.
H5375 - 1Sa 14:17 - Then said ^H559 Saul ^H7586 unto the people ^H5971 that were with him, Number ^H6485 now, and see ^H7200 who is gone ^H1980 from us. And when they had numbered, ^H6485 behold, Jonathan ^H3129 and his armourbearer ^H5375 ^H3627 were not there.
H5375 - 1Sa 15:25 - Now therefore, I pray thee, pardon ^H5375 my sin, ^H2403 and turn again ^H7725 with me, that I may worship ^H7812 the LORD. ^H3068
H5375 - 1Sa 16:21 - And David ^H1732 came ^H935 to Saul, ^H7586 and stood ^H5975 before ^H6440 him: and he loved ^H157 him greatly; ^H3966 and he became his armourbearer. ^H5375 ^H3627
H5375 - 1Sa 17:7 - And the staff ^H6086 ^H2671 of his spear ^H2595 was like a weaver's ^H707 beam; ^H4500 and his spear's ^H2595 head ^H3852 weighed six ^H8337 hundred ^H3967 shekels ^H8255 of iron: ^H1270 and one bearing ^H5375 a shield ^H6793 went ^H1980 before ^H6440 him.
H5375 - 1Sa 17:20 - And David ^H1732 rose up early ^H7925 in the morning, ^H1242 and left ^H5203 the sheep ^H6629 with a keeper, ^H8104 and took, ^H5375 and went, ^H3212 as Jesse ^H3448 had commanded ^H6680 him; and he came ^H935 to the trench, ^H4570 as the host ^H2428 was going forth ^H3318 to the fight, ^H4634 and shouted ^H7321 for the battle. ^H4421
H5375 - 1Sa 17:34 - And David ^H1732 said ^H559 unto Saul, ^H7586 Thy servant ^H5650 kept ^H7462 his father's ^H1 sheep, ^H6629 and there came ^H935 a lion, ^H738 and a bear, ^H1677 and took ^H5375 a lamb ^H7716 ^H2089 out of the flock: ^H5739
H5375 - 1Sa 17:41 - And the Philistine ^H6430 came ^H3212 on ^H1980 and drew near ^H7131 unto David; ^H1732 and the man ^H376 that bare ^H5375 the shield ^H6793 went before ^H6440 him.
H5375 - 1Sa 22:18 - And the king ^H4428 said ^H559 to Doeg, ^H1673 Turn ^H5437 thou, and fall ^H6293 upon the priests. ^H3548 And Doeg ^H1673 the Edomite ^H130 turned, ^H5437 and he fell ^H6293 upon the priests, ^H3548 and slew ^H4191 on that day ^H3117 fourscore ^H8084 and five ^H2568 persons ^H376 that did wear ^H5375 a linen ^H906 ephod. ^H646
H5375 - 1Sa 24:16 - And it came to pass, when David ^H1732 had made an end ^H3615 of speaking ^H1696 these words ^H1697 unto Saul, ^H7586 that Saul ^H7586 said, ^H559 Is this thy voice, ^H6963 my son ^H1121 David? ^H1732 And Saul ^H7586 lifted up ^H5375 his voice, ^H6963 and wept. ^H1058
H5375 - 1Sa 25:28 - I pray thee, forgive ^H5375 the trespass ^H6588 of thine handmaid: ^H519 for the LORD ^H3068 will certainly ^H6213 make ^H6213 my lord ^H113 a sure ^H539 house; ^H1004 because my lord ^H113 fighteth ^H3898 the battles ^H4421 of the LORD, ^H3068 and evil ^H7451 hath not been found ^H4672 in thee all thy days. ^H3117
H5375 - 1Sa 25:35 - So David ^H1732 received ^H3947 of her hand ^H3027 that which she had brought ^H935 him, and said ^H559 unto her, Go up ^H5927 in peace ^H7965 to thine house; ^H1004 see, ^H7200 I have hearkened ^H8085 to thy voice, ^H6963 and have accepted ^H5375 thy person. ^H6440
H5375 - 1Sa 30:4 - Then David ^H1732 and the people ^H5971 that were with him lifted up ^H5375 their voice ^H6963 and wept, ^H1058 until they had no more power ^H3581 to weep. ^H1058
H5375 - 1Sa 31:4 - Then said ^H559 Saul ^H7586 unto his armourbearer, ^H5375 ^H3627 Draw ^H8025 thy sword, ^H2719 and thrust me through ^H1856 therewith; lest these uncircumcised ^H6189 come ^H935 and thrust me through, ^H1856 and abuse ^H5953 me. But his armourbearer ^H5375 ^H3627 would ^H14 not; for he was sore ^H3966 afraid. ^H3372 Therefore Saul ^H7586 took ^H3947 a sword, ^H2719 and fell ^H5307 upon it.
H5375 - 1Sa 31:5 - And when his armourbearer ^H5375 ^H3627 saw ^H7200 that Saul ^H7586 was dead, ^H4191 he fell ^H5307 likewise upon his sword, ^H2719 and died ^H4191 with him.
H5375 - 1Sa 31:6 - So Saul ^H7586 died, ^H4191 and his three ^H7969 sons, ^H1121 and his armourbearer, ^H5375 ^H3627 and all his men, ^H582 that same day ^H3117 together. ^H3162
H5375 - 2Sa 2:22 - And Abner ^H74 said ^H559 again ^H3254 to Asahel, ^H6214 Turn thee aside ^H5493 from following ^H310 me: wherefore should I smite ^H5221 thee to the ground? ^H776 how then should I hold up ^H5375 my face ^H6440 to Joab ^H3097 thy brother? ^H251
H5375 - 2Sa 2:32 - And they took up ^H5375 Asahel, ^H6214 and buried ^H6912 him in the sepulchre ^H6913 of his father, ^H1 which was in Bethlehem. ^H1035 And Joab ^H3097 and his men ^H582 went ^H3212 all night, ^H3915 and they came to Hebron ^H2275 at break of day. ^H215

G0863 - Mat 3:15 - And ^G1161 Jesus ^G2424 answering ^G611 said ^G2036 unto ^G4314 him, ^G846 Suffer ^G863 it to be so now: ^G737 for ^G1063 thus ^G3779 it becometh ^G4241 ^G2076 us ^G2254 to fulfil ^G4137 all ^G3956 righteousness. ^G1343 Then ^G5119 he suffered ^G863 him. ^G846
G0863 - Mat 4:11 - Then ^G5119 the devil ^G1228 leaveth ^G863 him, ^G846 and, ^G2532 behold, ^G2400 angels ^G32 came ^G4334 and ^G2532 ministered ^G1247 unto him. ^G846
G0863 - Mat 4:20 - And ^G1161 they straightway ^G2112 left ^G863 their nets, ^G1350 and followed ^G190 him. ^G846
G0863 - Mat 4:22 - And ^G1161 they immediately ^G2112 left ^G863 the ship ^G4143 and ^G2532 their ^G846 father, ^G3962 and followed ^G190 him. ^G846

G0863 - Mat 5:40 - And ^G2532 if any man will ^G2309 sue ^G2919 ➔ thee ^G4671 at the law, ^G2919 and ^G2532 take away ^G2983 thy ^G4675 coat, ^G5509 let ^G863 ➔ him ^G846 have ^G863 thy cloke ^G2440 also. ^G2532
G0863 - Mat 6:12 - And ^G2532 forgive ^G863 us ^G2254 our ^G2257 debts, ^G3783 as ^G2532 ^G5613 we ^G2249 forgive ^G863 our ^G2257 debtors. ^G3781
G0863 - Mat 6:14 - For ^G1063 if ^G1437 ye forgive ^G863 men ^G444 their ^G846 trespasses, ^G3900 your ^G5216 heavenly ^G3770 Father ^G3962 will also ^G2532 forgive ^G863 you: ^G5213
G0863 - Mat 6:15 - But ^G1161 if ^G3362 ➔ ye forgive ^G863 not ^G3362 men ^G444 their ^G846 trespasses, ^G3900 neither ^G3761 will your ^G5216 Father ^G3962 forgive ^G863 your ^G5216 trespasses. ^G3900

G0863 - Mat 8:15 - And ^G2532 he touched ^G680 her ^G846 hand, ^G5495 and ^G2532 the fever ^G4446 left ^G863 her: ^G846 and ^G2532 she arose, ^G1453 and ^G2532 ministered ^G1247 unto them. ^G846
G0863 - Mat 8:22 - But ^G1161 Jesus ^G2424 said ^G2036 unto him, ^G846 Follow ^G190 me; ^G3427 and ^G2532 let ^G863 the dead ^G3498 bury ^G2290 their ^G1438 dead. ^G3498
G0863 - Mat 9:2 - And, ^G2532 behold, ^G2400 they brought ^G4374 to him ^G846 a man sick of the palsy, ^G3885 lying ^G906 on ^G1909 a bed: ^G2825 and ^G2532 Jesus ^G2424 seeing ^G1492 their ^G846 faith ^G4102 said ^G2036 unto the sick of the palsy; ^G3885 Son, ^G5043 be of good cheer; ^G2293 thy ^G4675 sins ^G266 be forgiven ^G863 thee. ^G4671
G0863 - Mat 9:5 - For ^G1063 whether ^G5101 is ^G2076 easier, ^G2123 to say, ^G2036 Thy sins ^G266 be forgiven ^G863 thee; ^G4671 or ^G2228 to say, ^G2036 Arise, ^G1453 and ^G2532 walk? ^G4043
G0863 - Mat 9:6 - But ^G1161 that ^G2443 ye may know ^G1492 that ^G3754 the Son ^G5207 of man ^G444 hath ^G2192 power ^G1849 on ^G1909 earth ^G1093 to forgive ^G863 sins, ^G266 (then ^G5119 saith he ^G3004 to the sick of the palsy,) ^G3885 Arise, ^G1453 take up ^G142 thy ^G4675 bed, ^G2825 and ^G2532 go ^G5217 unto ^G1519 thine ^G4675 house. ^G3624
G0863 - Mat 12:31 - Wherefore ^G1223 ^G5124 I say ^G3004 unto you, ^G5213 All manner of ^G3956 sin ^G266 and ^G2532 blasphemy ^G988 shall be forgiven ^G863 unto men: ^G444 but ^G1161 the blasphemy ^G988 against the Holy Ghost ^G4151 shall ^G863 ➔ not ^G3756 be forgiven ^G863 unto men. ^G444

G0863 - Mat 13:30 - Let ^G863 both ^G297 grow together ^G4885 until ^G3360 the harvest: ^G2326 and ^G2532 in ^G1722 the time ^G2540 of harvest ^G2326 I will say ^G2046 to the reapers, ^G2327 Gather ye together ^G4816 first ^G4412 the tares, ^G2215 and ^G2532 bind ^G1210 them ^G846 in ^G1519 bundles ^G1197 to ^G4314 burn ^G2618 them: ^G846 but ^G1161 gather ^G4863 the wheat ^G4621 into ^G1519 my ^G3450 barn. ^G596
G0863 - Mat 13:36 - Then ^G5119 Jesus ^G2424 sent ^G863 ➔ the multitude ^G3793 away, ^G863 and went ^G2064 into ^G1519 the house: ^G3614 and ^G2532 his ^G846 disciples ^G3101 came ^G4334 unto him, ^G846 saying, ^G3004 Declare ^G5419 unto us ^G2254 the parable ^G3850 of the tares ^G2215 of the field. ^G68
G0863 - Mat 15:14 - Let ^G863 ➔ them ^G846 alone: ^G863 they be ^G1526 blind ^G5185 leaders ^G3595 of the blind. ^G5185 And ^G1161 if ^G1437 the blind ^G5185 lead ^G3594 the blind, ^G5185 both ^G297 shall fall ^G4098 into ^G1519 the ditch. ^G999

G0863 - Mat 18:21 - Then ^G5119 came ^G4334 Peter ^G4074 to him, ^G846 and said, ^G2036 Lord, ^G2962 how oft ^G4212 shall my ^G3450 brother ^G80 sin ^G264 against ^G1519 me, ^G1691 and ^G2532 I forgive ^G863 him? ^G846 till ^G2193 seven times? ^G2034
G0863 - Mat 18:27 - Then ^G1161 the lord ^G2962 of that ^G1565 servant ^G1401 was moved with compassion, ^G4697 and loosed ^G630 him, ^G846 and ^G2532 forgave ^G863 him ^G846 the debt. ^G1156
G0863 - Mat 18:32 - Then ^G5119 his ^G846 lord, ^G2962 after that he had called ^G4341 him, ^G846 said ^G3004 unto him, ^G846 O thou wicked ^G4190 servant, ^G1401 I forgave ^G863 thee ^G4671 all ^G3956 that ^G1565 debt, ^G3782 because ^G1893 thou desiredst ^G3870 me: ^G3165
G0863 - Mat 18:35 - So ^G3779 likewise shall my ^G3450 heavenly ^G2032 Father ^G3962 do ^G4160 also ^G2532 unto you, ^G5213 if ^G3362 ➔ ye from ^G575 your ^G5216 hearts ^G2588 forgive ^G863 not ^G3362 every one ^G1538 his ^G846 brother ^G80 their ^G846 trespasses. ^G3900

G0863 - Mat 19:27 - Then ^G5119 answered ^G611 Peter ^G4074 and said ^G2036 unto him, ^G846 Behold, ^G2400 we ^G2249 have forsaken ^G863 all, ^G3956 and ^G2532 followed ^G190 thee; ^G4671 what ^G5101 shall we ^G2254 have ^G2071 therefore? ^G686
G0863 - Mat 19:29 - And ^G2532 every ^G3956 one ^G3739 that hath forsaken ^G863 houses, ^G3614 or ^G2228 brethren, ^G80 or ^G2228 sisters, ^G79 or ^G2228 father, ^G3962 or ^G2228 mother, ^G3384 or ^G2228 wife, ^G1135 or ^G2228 children, ^G5043 or ^G2228 lands, ^G68 for my ^G3450 name's ^G3686 sake, ^G1752 shall receive ^G2983 an hundredfold, ^G1542 and ^G2532 shall inherit ^G2816 everlasting ^G166 life. ^G2222
G0863 - Mat 22:22 - When ^G2532 they had heard ^G191 these words, they marvelled, ^G2296 and ^G2532 left ^G863 him, ^G846 and went their way. ^G565
G0863 - Mat 22:25 - Now ^G1161 there were ^G2258 with ^G3844 us ^G2254 seven ^G2033 brethren: ^G80 and ^G2532 the first, ^G4413 when he had married a wife, ^G1060 deceased, ^G5053 and, ^G2532 having ^G2192 no ^G3361 issue, ^G4690 left ^G863 his ^G846 wife ^G1135 unto his ^G846 brother: ^G80
G0863 - Mat 23:13 - But ^G1161 woe ^G3759 unto you, ^G5213 scribes ^G1122 and ^G2532 Pharisees, ^G5330 hypocrites! ^G5273 for ^G3754 ye shut up ^G2808 the kingdom ^G932 of heaven ^G3772 against ^G1715 men: ^G444 for ^G1063 ye ^G5210 neither ^G3761 go in ^G1525 yourselves, neither ^G3756 suffer ye ^G863 them that are entering ^G1525 to go in. ^G1525
G0863 - Mat 23:23 - Woe ^G3759 unto you, ^G5213 scribes ^G1122 and ^G2532 Pharisees, ^G5330 hypocrites! ^G5273 for ^G3754 ye pay tithe ^G586 of mint ^G2238 and ^G2532 anise ^G432 and ^G2532 cummin, ^G2951 and ^G2532 have omitted ^G863 the weightier ^G926 matters of the law, ^G3551 judgment, ^G2920 ^G2532 mercy, ^G1656 and ^G2532 faith: ^G4102 these ^G5023 ought ye ^G1163 to have done, ^G4160 and not ^G3361 to leave ^G863 ➔ the other ^G2548 undone. ^G863
G0863 - Mat 23:38 - Behold, ^G2400 your ^G5216 house ^G3624 is left ^G863 unto you ^G5213 desolate. ^G2048
G0863 - Mat 24:2 - And ^G1161 Jesus ^G2424 said ^G2036 unto them, ^G846 See ye ^G991 not ^G3756 all ^G3956 these things? ^G5023 verily ^G281 I say ^G3004 unto you, ^G5213 There shall ^G863 ➔ not ^G3364 be left ^G863 here ^G5602 one stone ^G3037 upon ^G1909 another, ^G3037 that ^G3739 shall ^G2647 ➔ not ^G3364 be thrown down. ^G2647
G0863 - Mat 24:40 - Then ^G5119 shall ^G2071 ➔ two ^G1417 be ^G2071 in ^G1722 the field; ^G68 the one ^G1520 shall be taken, ^G3880 and ^G2532 the other ^G1520 left. ^G863

G0863 - Mat 26:44 - And ^G2532 he left ^G863 them, ^G846 and went away ^G565 again, ^G3825 and prayed ^G4336 ^G1537 the third time, ^G5154 saying ^G2036 the same ^G846 words. ^G3056
G0863 - Mat 26:56 - But ^G1161 all ^G3650 this ^G5124 was done, ^G1096 that ^G2443 the scriptures ^G1124 of the prophets ^G4396 might be fulfilled. ^G4137 Then ^G5119 all ^G3956 the disciples ^G3101 forsook ^G863 him, ^G846 and fled. ^G5343
G0863 - Mat 27:49 - The ^G1161 rest ^G3062 said, ^G3004 Let be, ^G863 let us see ^G1492 whether ^G1487 Elias ^G2243 will come ^G2064 to save ^G4982 him. ^G846
G0863 - Mat 27:50 -  ^G1161 Jesus, ^G2424 when he had cried ^G2896 again ^G3825 with a loud ^G3173 voice, ^G5456 yielded up ^G863 the ghost. ^G4151
G0863 - Mar 1:18 - And ^G2532 straightway ^G2112 they forsook ^G863 their ^G846 nets, ^G1350 and followed ^G190 him. ^G846
G0863 - Mar 1:20 - And ^G2532 straightway ^G2112 he called ^G2564 them: ^G846 and ^G2532 they left ^G863 their ^G846 father ^G3962 Zebedee ^G2199 in ^G1722 the ship ^G4143 with ^G3326 the hired servants, ^G3411 and went ^G565 after ^G3694 him. ^G846
G0863 - Mar 1:31 - And ^G2532 he came ^G4334 and took ^G2902 her ^G846 by the hand, ^G5495 and lifted ^G1453 ➔ her ^G846 up; ^G1453 and ^G2532 immediately ^G2112 the fever ^G4446 left ^G863 her, ^G846 and ^G2532 she ministered ^G1247 unto them. ^G846
G0863 - Mar 1:34 - And ^G2532 he healed ^G2323 many ^G4183 that were ^G2192 sick ^G2560 of divers ^G4164 diseases, ^G3554 and ^G2532 cast out ^G1544 many ^G4183 devils; ^G1140 and ^G2532 suffered ^G863 not ^G3756 the devils ^G1140 to speak, ^G2980 because ^G3754 they knew ^G1492 him. ^G846
G0863 - Mar 2:5 - When ^G1161 Jesus ^G2424 saw ^G1492 their ^G846 faith, ^G4102 he said ^G3004 unto the sick of the palsy, ^G3885 Son, ^G5043 thy ^G4675 sins ^G266 be forgiven ^G863 thee. ^G4671
G0863 - Mar 2:7 - Why ^G5101 doth ^G2980 ➔ this ^G3778 man thus ^G3779 speak ^G2980 blasphemies? ^G988 who ^G5101 can ^G1410 forgive ^G863 sins ^G266 but ^G1508 God ^G2316 only? ^G1520
G0863 - Mar 2:9 - Whether ^G5101 is it ^G2076 easier ^G2123 to say ^G2036 to the sick of the palsy, ^G3885 Thy sins ^G266 be forgiven ^G863 thee; ^G4671 or ^G2228 to say, ^G2036 Arise, ^G1453 and ^G2532 take up ^G142 thy ^G4675 bed, ^G2895 and ^G2532 walk? ^G4043
G0863 - Mar 2:10 - But ^G1161 that ^G2443 ye may know ^G1492 that ^G3754 the Son ^G5207 of man ^G444 hath ^G2192 power ^G1849 on ^G1909 earth ^G1093 to forgive ^G863 sins, ^G266 (he saith ^G3004 to the sick of the palsy,) ^G3885
G0863 - Mar 3:28 - Verily ^G281 I say ^G3004 unto you, ^G5213 ^G3754 All ^G3956 sins ^G265 shall be forgiven ^G863 unto the sons ^G5207 of men, ^G444 and ^G2532 blasphemies ^G988 wherewith ^G3745 soever ^G302 they shall blaspheme: ^G987
G0863 - Mar 4:12 - That ^G2443 seeing ^G991 they may see, ^G991 and ^G2532 not ^G3361 perceive; ^G1492 and ^G2532 hearing ^G191 they may hear, ^G191 and ^G2532 not ^G3361 understand; ^G4920 lest at any time ^G3379 they should be converted, ^G1994 and ^G2532 their sins ^G265 should be forgiven ^G863 them. ^G846
G0863 - Mar 4:36 - And ^G2532 when they had sent away ^G863 the multitude, ^G3793 they took ^G3880 him ^G846 even as ^G5613 he was ^G2258 in ^G1722 the ship. ^G4143 And ^G1161 there were ^G2258 also ^G2532 with ^G3326 him ^G846 other ^G243 little ships. ^G4142
G0863 - Mar 5:19 - Howbeit ^G1161 Jesus ^G2424 suffered ^G863 him ^G846 not, ^G3756 but ^G235 saith ^G3004 unto him, ^G846 Go ^G5217 home ^G1519 ^G3624 ^G4675 to ^G4314 thy friends, ^G4674 and ^G2532 tell ^G312 them ^G846 how great things ^G3745 the Lord ^G2962 hath done ^G4160 for thee, ^G4671 and ^G2532 hath had compassion ^G1653 on thee. ^G4571
G0863 - Mar 5:37 - And ^G2532 he suffered ^G863 ^G3756 no man ^G3762 to follow ^G4870 him, ^G846 save ^G1508 Peter, ^G4074 and ^G2532 James, ^G2385 and ^G2532 John ^G2491 the brother ^G80 of James. ^G2385
G0863 - Mar 7:8 - For ^G1063 laying aside ^G863 the commandment ^G1785 of God, ^G2316 ye hold ^G2902 the tradition ^G3862 of men, ^G444 as the washing ^G909 of pots ^G3582 and ^G2532 cups: ^G4221 and ^G2532 many ^G4183 other ^G243 such ^G5108 like things ^G3946 ye do. ^G4160
G0863 - Mar 7:12 - And ^G2532 ye suffer ^G863 him ^G846 no more ^G3765 to do ^G4160 ought ^G3762 for his ^G846 father ^G3962 or ^G2228 his ^G846 mother; ^G3384
G0863 - Mar 7:27 - But ^G1161 Jesus ^G2424 said ^G2036 unto her, ^G846 Let ^G863 the children ^G5043 first ^G4412 be filled: ^G5526 for ^G1063 it is ^G2076 not ^G3756 meet ^G2570 to take ^G2983 the children's ^G5043 bread, ^G740 and ^G2532 to cast ^G906 it unto the dogs. ^G2952
G0863 - Mar 8:13 - And ^G2532 he left ^G863 them, ^G846 and entering ^G1684 into ^G1519 the ship ^G4143 again ^G3825 departed ^G565 to ^G1519 the other side. ^G4008

G0863 - Jhn 14:27 - Peace ^G1515 I leave ^G863 with you, ^G5213 my ^G1699 peace ^G1515 I give ^G1325 unto you: ^G5213 not ^G3756 as ^G2531 the world ^G2889 giveth, ^G1325 give ^G1325 I ^G1473 unto you. ^G5213 Let ^G5015 ➔ not ^G3361 your ^G5216 heart ^G2588 be troubled, ^G5015 neither ^G3366 let it be afraid. ^G1168
G0863 - Jhn 16:28 - I came forth ^G1831 from ^G3844 the Father, ^G3962 and ^G2532 am come ^G2064 into ^G1519 the world: ^G2889 again, ^G3825 I leave ^G863 the world, ^G2889 and ^G2532 go ^G4198 to ^G4314 the Father. ^G3962
G0863 - Jhn 16:32 - Behold, ^G2400 the hour ^G5610 cometh, ^G2064 yea, ^G2532 is ^G2064 ➔ now ^G3568 come, ^G2064 that ^G2443 ye shall be scattered, ^G4650 every man ^G1538 to ^G1519 his own, ^G2398 and ^G2532 shall leave ^G863 me ^G1691 alone: ^G3441 and yet ^G2532 I am ^G1510 not ^G3756 alone, ^G3441 because ^G3754 the Father ^G3962 is ^G2076 with ^G3326 me. ^G1700
G0863 - Jhn 18:8 - Jesus ^G2424 answered, ^G611 I have told ^G2036 you ^G5213 that ^G3754 I ^G1473 am ^G1510 he: if ^G1487 therefore ^G3767 ye seek ^G2212 me, ^G1691 let ^G863 these ^G5128 go their way: ^G5217
G0863 - Jhn 20:23 - Whose ^G5100 soever ^G302 sins ^G266 ye remit, ^G863 they are remitted ^G863 unto them; ^G846 and whose ^G5100 soever ^G302 sins ye retain, ^G2902 they are retained. ^G2902
G0863 - Act 8:22 - Repent ^G3340 therefore ^G3767 of ^G575 this ^G5026 thy ^G4675 wickedness, ^G2549 and ^G2532 pray ^G1189 God, ^G2316 if ^G1487 perhaps ^G686 the thought ^G1963 of thine ^G4675 heart ^G2588 may be forgiven ^G863 thee. ^G4671
G0863 - Act 14:17 - Nevertheless ^G2544 ^G2532 he left ^G863 not ^G3756 himself ^G1438 without witness, ^G267 in that he did good, ^G15 and gave ^G1325 us ^G2254 rain ^G5205 from heaven, ^G3771 and ^G2532 fruitful ^G2593 seasons, ^G2540 filling ^G1705 our ^G2257 hearts ^G2588 with food ^G5160 and ^G2532 gladness. ^G2167
G0863 - Rom 1:27 - And ^G5037 likewise ^G3668 also ^G2532 the men, ^G730 leaving ^G863 the natural ^G5446 use ^G5540 of the woman, ^G2338 burned ^G1572 in ^G1722 their ^G846 lust ^G3715 one toward another; ^G1519 ^G240 men ^G730 with ^G1722 men ^G730 working ^G2716 that which is unseemly, ^G808 and ^G2532 receiving ^G618 in ^G1722 themselves ^G1438 that recompence ^G489 of their ^G846 error ^G4106 which ^G3739 was meet. ^G1163
G0863 - Rom 4:7 - Saying, Blessed ^G3107 are they whose ^G3739 iniquities ^G458 are forgiven, ^G863 and ^G2532 whose ^G3739 sins ^G266 are covered. ^G1943
G0863 - 1Co 7:11 - But ^G1161 and ^G2532 if ^G1437 she depart, ^G5563 let her remain ^G3306 unmarried, ^G22 or ^G2228 be reconciled ^G2644 to her husband: ^G435 and ^G2532 let ^G863 ➔ not ^G3361 the husband ^G435 put away ^G863 his wife. ^G1135
G0863 - 1Co 7:12 - But ^G1161 to the rest ^G3062 speak ^G3004 I, ^G1473 not ^G3756 the Lord: ^G2962 If any ^G1536 brother ^G80 hath ^G2192 a wife ^G1135 that believeth not, ^G571 and ^G2532 she ^G846 be pleased ^G4909 to dwell ^G3611 with ^G3326 him, ^G846 let him ^G863 ➔ not ^G3361 put ^G863 ➔ her ^G846 away. ^G863
G0863 - 1Co 7:13 - And ^G2532 the woman ^G1135 which ^G3748 hath ^G2192 an husband ^G435 that believeth not, ^G571 and ^G2532 if he ^G846 be pleased ^G4909 to dwell ^G3611 with ^G3326 her, ^G846 let her ^G863 ➔ not ^G3361 leave ^G863 him. ^G846
G0863 - Heb 2:8 - Thou hast put ^G5293 ➔ all things ^G3956 in subjection ^G5293 under ^G5270 his ^G846 feet. ^G4228 For ^G1063 in ^G1722 that he put ^G5293 ➔ all ^G3956 in subjection under ^G5293 him, ^G846 he left ^G863 nothing that is not ^G3762 put under ^G506 him. ^G846 But ^G1161 now ^G3568 we see ^G3708 not yet ^G3768 all things ^G3956 put under ^G5293 him. ^G846
G0863 - Heb 6:1 - Therefore ^G1352 leaving ^G863 the principles ^G746 of the doctrine ^G3056 of Christ, ^G5547 let us go on ^G5342 unto ^G1909 perfection; ^G5047 not ^G3361 laying ^G2598 again ^G3825 the foundation ^G2310 of repentance ^G3341 from ^G575 dead ^G3498 works, ^G2041 and ^G2532 of faith ^G4102 toward ^G1909 God, ^G2316
G0863 - Jas 5:15 - And ^G2532 the prayer ^G2171 of faith ^G4102 shall save ^G4982 the sick, ^G2577 and ^G2532 the Lord ^G2962 shall raise ^G1453 ➔ him ^G846 up; ^G1453 and if ^G2579 he have ^G5600 committed ^G4160 sins, ^G266 they shall be forgiven ^G863 him. ^G846
G0863 - 1Jo 1:9 - If ^G1437 we confess ^G3670 our ^G2257 sins, ^G266 he is ^G2076 faithful ^G4103 and ^G2532 just ^G1342 to ^G2443 forgive ^G863 us ^G2254 our sins, ^G266 and ^G2532 to cleanse ^G2511 us ^G2248 from ^G575 all ^G3956 unrighteousness. ^G93
G0863 - 1Jo 2:12 - I write ^G1125 unto you, ^G5213 little children, ^G5040 because ^G3754 your sins ^G266 are forgiven ^G863 you ^G5213 for ^G1223 ➔ his ^G846 name's ^G3686 sake. ^G1223

G5483 - Luk 7:42 - And ^G1161 when they ^G846 had ^G2192 nothing ^G3361 to pay, ^G591 he frankly forgave ^G5483 them both. ^G297 Tell me ^G2036 therefore, ^G3767 which ^G5101 of them ^G846 will love ^G25 him ^G846 most? ^G4119
G5483 - Luk 7:43 - Simon ^G4613 answered ^G611 and ^G1161 said, ^G2036 I suppose ^G5274 that ^G3754 he, to whom ^G3739 he forgave ^G5483 most. ^G4119 And ^G1161 he said ^G2036 unto him, ^G846 Thou hast ^G2919 ➔ rightly ^G3723 judged. ^G2919
G5483 - Act 3:14 - But ^G1161 ye ^G5210 denied ^G720 the Holy One ^G40 and ^G2532 the Just, ^G1342 and ^G2532 desired ^G154 a murderer ^G5406 ^G435 to be granted ^G5483 unto you; ^G5213
G5483 - Act 25:11 - For ^G1063 if ^G1487 ^G3303 I be an offender, ^G91 or ^G2532 have committed ^G4238 any thing ^G5100 worthy ^G514 of death, ^G2288 I refuse ^G3868 not ^G3756 to die: ^G599 but ^G1161 if ^G1487 there be ^G2076 none ^G3762 of these things ^G3739 whereof these ^G3778 accuse ^G2723 me, ^G3450 no man ^G3762 may ^G1410 deliver ^G5483 me ^G3165 unto them. ^G846 I appeal unto ^G1941 Caesar. ^G2541
G5483 - Act 25:16 - To ^G4314 whom ^G3739 I answered, ^G611 ^G3754 It is ^G2076 not ^G3756 the manner ^G1485 of the Romans ^G4514 to deliver ^G5483 any ^G5100 man ^G444 to ^G1519 die, ^G684 before ^G4250 that ^G2228 he which is accused ^G2723 have ^G2192 the accusers ^G2725 face to face, ^G2596 ^G4383 ^G5037 and have ^G2983 licence ^G5117 to answer for himself ^G627 concerning ^G4012 the crime laid against him. ^G1462
G5483 - Act 27:24 - Saying, ^G3004 Fear ^G5399 not, ^G3361 Paul; ^G3972 thou ^G4571 must ^G1163 be brought before ^G3936 Caesar: ^G2541 and, ^G2532 lo, ^G2400 God ^G2316 hath given ^G5483 thee ^G4671 all ^G3956 them that sail ^G4126 with ^G3326 thee. ^G4675

G5483 - 2Co 2:10 -  ^G1161 To whom ^G3739 ye forgive ^G5483 any thing, ^G5100 I ^G1473 forgive also: ^G2532 for ^G2532 ^G1063 if I ^G1473 forgave ^G5483 any thing, ^G1536 to whom ^G3739 I forgave ^G5483 it, for your sakes ^G1223 ^G5209 forgave I it in ^G1722 the person ^G4383 of Christ; ^G5547

G5483 - Phl 2:9 - Wherefore ^G1352 God ^G2316 also ^G2532 hath highly exalted ^G5251 him, ^G846 and ^G2532 given ^G5483 him ^G846 a name ^G3686 which ^G3588 is above ^G5228 every ^G3956 name: ^G3686
G5483 - Col 2:13 - And ^G2532 you, ^G5209 being ^G5607 dead ^G3498 in ^G1722 your sins ^G3900 and ^G2532 the uncircumcision ^G203 of your ^G5216 flesh, ^G4561 hath he quickened together ^G4806 with ^G4862 him, ^G846 having forgiven ^G5483 you ^G5213 all ^G3956 trespasses; ^G3900

G5483 - Phm 1:22 - But ^G1161 withal ^G260 prepare ^G2090 me ^G3427 also ^G2532 a lodging: ^G3578 for ^G1063 I trust ^G1679 that ^G3754 through ^G1223 your ^G5216 prayers ^G4335 I shall be given ^G5483 unto you. ^G5213
